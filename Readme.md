Basic Finite-difference modelling for seismic wave propagation

- [ ] Add a 2-space 2-time FD modelling notebook for simple model
- [ ] Add an example to show the effect of boundary condition
- [ ] Add an example notebook to show the effect of numerical dispersion
- [ ] Add an example notebook to show the effect of 2-space 2-time vs 4-space 2-time notebook
- [ ] Add an example to model multiple shots for marmousi data
